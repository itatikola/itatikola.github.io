    <p>Hi! Thanks so much for stopping by.</p>
    <p>I'm a CS major at the Georgia Institute of Technology concentrating in 
        Intelligence and Systems & Architecture.
    </p>
    <p>Building human-centered applications excites me.</p>
    <p>Over the next year, I'm challenging myself to create one,
        full-fledged personal project per month. Follow along on the "Projects" tab (coming soon).
    </p>
    <p>Outside of CS, I love fashion, writing, and baking!</p>
    <p>Feel free to reach out on my socials.</p>
