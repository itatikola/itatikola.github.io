    <p>Hi! Thanks so much for stopping by.</p>
    <p>I'm a CS major at the Georgia Institute of Technology concentrating in 
        Intelligence and Systems & Architecture.
    </p>
    <p>Building human-centered applications excites me.</p>
    <p>Over the next year, I'm challenging myself to create one personal project or write a blog post every month 
        Follow along on the "Projects" and "Blog" tab.
    </p>
    <p>I love talking about my passions (fashion, art, and writing), and I also consider computer science a passion.</p>
    <p>I think this challenge will allow me to keep doing the things that I've always wanted to do.</p>
    <p>Feel free to reach out on my socials.</p>
