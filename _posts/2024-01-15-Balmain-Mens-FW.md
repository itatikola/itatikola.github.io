&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris Fashion Week 2024 featured some amazing collections with many critics remarking on the return of true haute couture - art as fashion. Pieces were bold, vibrant, and meaningful across the board. However, Balmain Mens’ FW 24, designed by the young breakthrough Olivier Rouesting, was a standout.  <!--more--> Last year, Rouesting revealed that he had been badly burned during a fireplace explosion in his own home. He had kept the incident private for a long time, and his return invoked a newfound sense of purpose. In fact, his new braids almost made him unrecognizable when he came out at the end of the show. I found the show to be an unabashed homage to African royalty and modern Afro-European culture, celebrating the work of modern African art and revealing the impact of African creatives on global fashion. This show was defined by coats, vibrant colors, and royal futurism.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most powerful sequence in the show to me were the black and metallic gold looks. The sequence began abruptly with the structured, reflective coat. The long coat’s rigidity and simple structure felt like something a fashionable CP-30 would wear in the best way possible. This is a coat meant for the night, an ode to being the shining light of royalty in the room. The sharp corners of the shoulders and abrupt circular ending to the sleeve furthers the roboticism. All in all, I find it to be an exciting step towards pure futuristic style. The pairing with faded black denim works, although the jeans are of a certain tasteless style. I’ll chalk it up to the specific connotation this jean style has in American culture.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the gold motif was a strong example of celebrating African greatness. I immediately think of Mansa Musa - the African king who was at one point the richest man in the world due to his hefty collection of gold. In the eastern world, gold is most definitely the greatest symbol of wealth though it has largely left the gaze of western idyllism. The golden durag and chains are also odes to the unique and unmatched significance of gold as a symbol of power and royalty in African culture.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vibrant orange, pink, yellow and black patent leather jacket and then shiny leather bag immediately caught my eye. The splotching design reminded me of the eye itself actually - a cornea or on another note, a celestial supernova. It radiates power and an all-knowing existentialism, though I wish the jackets colors were as vibrant as the bags.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most striking of all however was the facial sequence. The show opened with the long coat featuring an AI-generated face created with what seems to be rhinestones. This is an ode to the technological aspect of futurism that simply cannot be ignored, Rouesting is acknowledging the dominance of artificial intelligence in all aspects of life. The use of rhinestones creates a pixelated effect, adding onto the illusion that the pieces are made of actual screens. The black and white eye specifically reminds me of the type of image you would see in a 2000s era girls’ internet makeup game - it’s almost Bratz-like. In this way, Rouesting preserves the youthful streetwear roots of Balmain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the underlying reason I was drawn to this show is because of its outstanding progressiveness. I truly believe that Olivier Rouesting understands the future and I respect that he is using his influence and genius to propel his people and culture to the forefront of the future. African royalty, digital supremacy, artificial intelligence in art - Rouesting is a master of representing the here and now. He defines a generation and I cannot wait to see how this collection manifests in the mainstream.
