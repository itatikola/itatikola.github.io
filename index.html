    <p>Hi! Thanks so much for stopping by. Here's a little about me.</p>
    <p>I'm a CS major at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I'm concentrating in 
        Intelligence and Systems & Architecture.
    </p>
    <p>Building human-centered applications excites me.</p>
    <p>Over the next year, I'm challenging myself to create one,
        full-fledged personal project a month.
