    <p>Hi! Thanks so much for stopping by.</p>
    <p>I'm a CS major at the Georgia Institute of Technology concentrating in 
        Intelligence and Systems & Architecture.
    </p>
    <p>I have a strong passion for making technology that makes our world 
        more accessible and making technology more accessible for everyone in the world (say that 5 times fast). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of CS, I love cooking, I love fashion, and I have a love/hate relationship with running. 
        I just saw the movie "Challengers," too.
