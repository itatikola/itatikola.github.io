<p>Welcome to my blog! Outside of computer science, I love fashion, art, and writing.</p>
<p>In another life, I would be a magazine editor, so consider this as me living out that dream.</p>
<p>At the very least, I just like to write about beautiful things.</p>

  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <div class="post-thumbnail">
      <h1><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h1>
      <p>{{ post.date | date_to_string: "ordinal", "US" }}</p>
      <p>{{ post.excerpt }}</p>
    </div>
  {% endfor %}
